- Accent color: Muted violet (#9575CD), providing a gentle highlight that complements the indigo hues without overpowering the interface.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif known for its contemporary, fashionable, and avant-garde qualities.
- Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif providing a modern and neutral look. Used with 'Poppins' for headlines.
- Use simple, line-based icons for a clean and modern look. Icons should be related to chat functionality, such as sending, receiving, and status indicators.
- The chat interface should be clean and intuitive, with a clear distinction between user and bot messages. Use a simple layout with the input field at the bottom and messages displayed in a chronological order.
- Use subtle animations for new messages, such as a gentle fade-in effect, to enhance user experience without being distracting.
