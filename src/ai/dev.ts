// Flows will be imported for their side effects in this file.
// For example:
// import './flows/onboardingChatFlow'; // If onboardingChatFlow.ts used ai.defineFlow

// Since we are using server actions in app/onboarding/actions.ts for this specific
// onboarding logic, there might not be Genkit flows to register here unless
// other AI features are added.
